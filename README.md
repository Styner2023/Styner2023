<p align="center">
I'm Styner Stiner, an accomplished Agile leader and full-stack developer with a deep passion for artificial intelligence, C++ programming, and software development. Coding has always been my dream, and I am committed to becoming an engineer. I am currently attending Dominican University of California, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Beyond my technical pursuits, I am skilled in using Docker and various AWS services, including S3, Route 53, and EC2. I am dedicated to giving back to the community through public speaking and volunteering. I regularly speak to students at UCLA and Bishop O'Dowd High School on social justice, climate change, and mental health, and actively participate in the Canticle Farm community. I am fluent in English and Dutch, with beginner proficiency in French. My journey in tech is driven by a desire to innovate, solve real-world problems, and make a positive impact in the lives of others through code and community engagement.
